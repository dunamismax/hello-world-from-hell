## What Fresh Hell Is This?

This repository contains a Hello World program that demonstrates advanced C programming techniques through intentional obfuscation. It summons "Hello World!" through eleven different dimensions of cursed sorcery, each more twisted than the last.

## The Cursed Arsenal

**Trigraph Witchcraft**: Extensive use of `??<` `??>` `??!` because normal brackets are for the weak and unenlightened.

**Macro Demonology**: Over 30 macros with names like `CHAOS`, `CURSE`, `RITUAL`, `SUMMON`, and `PHANTOM` that twist reality itself.

**Eleven Circles of Hell**: Each execution randomly selects one of eleven ways to torture your terminal:

- Dimensional shift with union bit manipulation
- Fibonacci sequence obfuscation  
- Duff's device horror with unrolled loops
- Trigraph nightmare fuel
- Signal handler mayhem
- Recursive descent into madness
- Pointer arithmetic insanity
- Macro expansion hell
- Quantum entanglement with complex mathematics
- Parallel dimension chaos with threading
- SIMD vectorized torment

**Advanced Features**:

- Cross-platform SIMD support (AVX2/NEON)
- Atomic operations and threading
- Complex number mathematics
- Multi-dimensional parallel processing

## Summoning Instructions

### The Primary Ritual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/hello-world-from-hell.git
cd hello-world-from-hell
make hell  # The complete ritual
```

This will build the binary, run tests, demonstrate all cursed modes, and unleash hell upon your terminal.

### Command Incantations

```bash
# Basic invocations
make                    # Forge the cursed binary
./cursed_spawn         # Execute random hellish dimension
./cursed_spawn --help  # Display the unholy documentation

# Force specific dimensions of suffering
./cursed_spawn -d 0    # Dimensional shift
./cursed_spawn -d 1    # Fibonacci madness
./cursed_spawn -d 3    # Trigraph nightmare

# Modern cursed features
./cursed_spawn -q      # Quantum entanglement horror
./cursed_spawn -s      # SIMD vectorized hell
./cursed_spawn -t      # Parallel dimension chaos

# Control the madness
./cursed_spawn -c 42      # Set chaos counter seed
./cursed_spawn -r 5       # Repeat ritual 5 times
./cursed_spawn -d 1 -r 3  # Combined parameters

# Development rituals
make test     # Run comprehensive test suite
make bench    # Performance benchmarks
make debug    # Build with sanitizers
make profile  # Profile execution
```

## Expected Manifestations

Depending on which circle of hell you're visiting, you might see:

- `Hello World!` (if you're lucky)
- `oW olleH\n!dlr` (dimensional reversal)
- `H}elljo BWhorld*!` (fibonacci corruption)
- Incomprehensible SIMD-corrupted output
- Quantum-entangled character soup

## Why Does This Exist?

This serves multiple purposes:

1. **Educational**: Demonstrates advanced C programming techniques
2. **Compiler Testing**: Pushes trigraph support, macro expansion, and optimization
3. **Cross-Platform**: Tests SIMD, threading, and atomic operations across architectures
4. **Performance**: Benchmarks various approaches to the same simple task

## Technical Specifications

- **Languages**: C17 with GNU extensions
- **Architectures**: x86_64, ARM64
- **Platforms**: macOS, Linux
- **Test Coverage**: 100% pass rate (17/17 tests)
- **Performance**: ~300 operations/second across all hellish dimensions
- **Binary Size**: 52KB of concentrated evil

## Hall of Infamy

This cursed creation incorporates every forbidden technique:

- Trigraphs (RIP C23)
- Flexible array members in unions
- Constructor/destructor attributes
- Signal handlers
- setjmp/longjmp
- Volatile everything
- Duff's device
- Atomic operations
- Complex numbers
- SIMD intrinsics
- Multi-threading
- Aligned allocations

## Contributing

Found a way to make this even more cursed? Pull requests welcome! Guidelines:

- If your code doesn't make at least three senior developers weep, it's not cursed enough
- All new curses must pass the existing test suite
- Performance regressions will be sacrificed to the compiler gods
- Documentation must be suitably ominous
