## 🌚 What Fresh Hell Is This?

Behold, mortal programmer! Within this repository lies the ultimate abomination — a Hello World program that would make Cthulhu himself weep tears of admiration. This is not just code; it's a digital séance that summons "Hello World!" through **seven different dimensions of cursed C sorcery**.

## ⚡ Features From The Abyss

- **🔮 Trigraph Nightmare**: Extensive use of `??<` `??>` `??!` because normal brackets are for the weak
- **🎭 Macro Sorcery**: 25+ macros with names like `CHAOS`, `CURSE`, `RITUAL`, `SUMMON`, `PHANTOM`
- **🌪️ Duff's Device**: Loop unrolling so cursed it makes compilers question their existence
- **👻 Seven Hellish Methods**: Each run randomly selects how to torment your terminal:

  - Dimensional shift with union bit manipulation
  - Fibonacci sequence obfuscation
  - setjmp/longjmp chaos portals
  - Signal handler mayhem
  - Recursive nightmare functions
  - Pointer arithmetic insanity
  - Macro expansion hell

- **🔥 Portable Darkness**: Compiles on x86_64, ARM64, and probably your smart toaster
- **⚡ Modern Cursed**: Uses constructor/destructor attributes, volatile souls, and cosmic horror

## 🚀 Summoning Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/hello-world-from-hell.git
cd hello-world-from-hell
make
./a.out  # Abandon hope, all ye who execute here
```

**Expected Output**: `Hello World!` (or variations like `H}elljo BWhorld*!` depending on which circle of hell you're visiting)

## 🎪 Why Does This Exist?

Because someone had to prove that even a simple "Hello World" can be an exercise in digital demonology. This started as a challenge to create the most cursed C code possible while maintaining portability across architectures.

**Warning**: Reading this code may cause:

- Temporary loss of faith in humanity
- Uncontrollable urge to refactor everything
- Appreciation for normal, boring code
- Existential dread about the state of software engineering

## 🏆 Hall of Cursed Fame

This abomination features every dark art known to C programming:

- Trigraphs (RIP C23, we hardly knew ye)
- Flexible array members in unions
- Constructor/destructor attributes
- Signal handlers
- setjmp/longjmp
- Volatile everything
- Macro expansion that would make Satan proud

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a way to make this even more cursed? Pull requests welcome! Just remember: if your code doesn't make at least three senior developers cry, it's not cursed enough.
